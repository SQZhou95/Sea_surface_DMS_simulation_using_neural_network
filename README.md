# Sea_surface_DMS_simulation_using_neural_network
The repository Sea_surface_DMS_simulation_using_neural_network contains Matlab code to establish an artificial neural network (ANN) model and use it to simulate the concentration of sea surface dimethyl sulfide (DMS). It also contains Matlab code of global sensitivity analysis and partial dependence plot to unravel the relationships between DMS and input variables based constructed ANN. Questions and requests can be addressed to: sqzhou17@fudan.edu.cn.
